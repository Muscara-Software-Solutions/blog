Don't know how to securely share required student fields to Hallpass? Don't worry anymore, Hallpass allows for seamless integration with any of your existing Student Information Systems;

1. **Infinite Campus**.
2. **Google IAM**.
3. **RapidIdentity**
4. **and more**

Don't see your Student Information System on this list? No problem, the majority of SIS's offer an SFTP export option which Hallpass supports. [Contact support](mailto:support@hallpass.gg) for additional information.
