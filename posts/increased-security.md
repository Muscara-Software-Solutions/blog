Hallpass offers numerous comprehensive features, including **Custom Blacklists**. Blacklists allows you to restrict two or more students from leaving the classroom at the same time. 

Want to prevent those all too common friendly, or sometimes nonfriendly, meetups from happening during class time? Blacklists are the perfect solution.

Hallpass also offers real-time alerts for when students sign out of the classroom
