When students use Hallpass, their ability to sign out of the classroom is based on four factors;

1. **Daily limit**: The amount of passes a student is allowed to create per school day.
2. **Period limit**: The amount of passes a student is allowed to create per class period per semester.
3. **Semester limit**: The amount of passes a student is allowed to create per semester.
4. **Yearly limit**: The amount of passes a student is allowed to create per year.

These restrictions are 100% customizable, and can be changed at any time. This proves useful for students that are frequent flyers, simply update that students pass limits, and stop them from abusing their hallway privilage.
